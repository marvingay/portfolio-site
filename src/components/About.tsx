          Hi, Iâ€™m Marvin (if you didn't know)! I love music, sports, poker, and
          coding!
        </p>
        When im not working, you can most likely find me listening to spotify
        while watching basketball and playing a game of chess on my phone. Being
        an only child turned me into a computer nerd at a young age, and through
        that knowledge, programming has become another passion and hobby of
        mine.
